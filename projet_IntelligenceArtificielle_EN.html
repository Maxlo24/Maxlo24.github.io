                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I first coded my first genetic algorithm in <b>Python</b>. The goal was to solve the traveling salesman problem:<br>
                                        • Determine the shortest path that visits each city only once and ends in the starting city.

                                <!-- Image Description -->

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    • <b>Block (A)</b> represents the progress of the algorithm at various key moments.
                                    We start by creating a point cloud: 15 points randomly placed on a 10x10 pixel grid.
                                    The genetic algorithm begins by creating an initial population, in this case, a population of 100 routes.
                                    <br><br>
                                    • <b>Block (B)</b> corresponds to the description of these routes. They are all characterized by a list of points whose order is randomly determined. This list of points corresponds to the DNA of a route.
                                    
                                    To adhere to <b>Charles Darwin's theory of evolution</b>, we now proceed to natural <b>selection</b>. To do this, we rank the routes based on their length. The shorter the route, the higher it ranks.
                                    
                                    Now that our initial population is ranked, we select the top 25 routes. For more diversity, and once again taking inspiration from nature, we also select 25 lucky ones. These 25+25 selected routes will now be able to "reproduce."
                                    <br><br>
                                    • <b>Block (C)</b> represents the <b>reproduction</b> process, which involves choosing two "selected" routes (a father and a mother) and mixing their DNA to produce 4 new routes (4 children).
                                    The goal is to maintain a constant population (here, 100). Finally, a slight <b>mutation</b> is added to the DNA of the "children."
                                    <br><br>
                                    This process of <b>selection</b>/<b>reproduction</b>/<b>mutation</b> is repeated until there is no further improvement.
                                </p>

                                    The computing power at my disposal is not sufficient for efficient progress on this project. And it seems that a genetic algorithm is not the best solution for this problem.
